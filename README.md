# SameGame

This was a final programming project for EECS 132. No future revisions planned, but maybe I'll work on it more this summer.

Author: Thomas Patton

Rules:

The user will be presented with a 2 dimensional grid of buttons of various colors and random orientation. The dimensions of the board as well as the number of colors can be specified in the command line arguments.

Clicking a tile removes all tiles which are of the same color in a cross formation. Note that this does not include diagonals. After tiles are removed, the tiles above "fall" down leaving empty space above them.

The goal of the game is to have no tiles remaining. End condition is not programmed.
